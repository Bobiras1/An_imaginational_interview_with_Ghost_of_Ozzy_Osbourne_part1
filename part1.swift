print("Monday 28 July 2025 7:58 in the morning. I have a little coffe besides me and a few cigarettes. Me:Hello Ozzy! Ozzy: Hello! Me: so as I write those lines, you are not alive, but your legacy is so can you inform me on your current situation? Ozzy: well you know since I'm dead I had to pass from situation of life to a different one, but it is ok where I am, it is nice and you know lately in my life I had to face many problems like Parkinson disease. So yes now I feel I am in a good place, we could call it a pneumatical paradise. Me: this is good thing I suppose, can you see other people over there? Ozzy: Yep, John Lennon is here Lemmy Kilmister, Joey Jordison, Sean Malone, Vangelis Papathanasiou... Me: sounds like a good team!! Ozzy: Yes it feels fine. Me: I want to tell you something, I was unlucky to not have seen you on a Live performance when you were alive, I feel some short of a grief and sorrow because of this. Ozzy:Why do you think that happened between us? Me: I feel art, metal music, your music needs more appreciation more respect and time/careful thinking than that I could I achieve. What's done is done now isn't it? Ozzy: yeah but maybe you are doing the same old mistake again and again. Me: can we change subject? Ozzy Osbourne: yes of course! Me: Well we will start from a kinda reverse thinking to a more rational thinking on the go...you had some cars, you used to have an Aston Martin DB7, a Rolls Royce Phantom, and even a Ferrari 458 Italia..you liked driving and speed isnt it? Ozzy: yes I liked those cars you know?!even though I were not the best driver I loved this sence of being able to drive. Me: But now you cannot drive isnt it? Ozzy: Yes maybe I cannot drive but you know I am free to imagine vividly whatever I want!!!so when I feel I want to drive,I see moving, immersive, vivid pictures in front of me where I drive those cars. feels cool you know?! Me: that's nice! Me again after a small pause: so you had some kind of a higher power belief as I get it..you had said I’m not an atheist. I believe there’s something out there, a higher power or If people listened to the lyrics of Black Sabbath, they’d realize we were more Christian than most Christians, or ,I shouldn’t be alive, but somehow I am. I wanted to know why. Dr. Ozzy here is what I try to say...you used to sing dont you think there must be a reason, a greater reason beyond peoples minds so that they speak sing live their lives? Ozzy: I will repeat to you that my belief was there must be a higher power...above humans. And actually this is the reason why I am in paradise. Me: it is 9 in the morning here, we will make a pause.")
